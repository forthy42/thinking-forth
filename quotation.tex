\begin{quotation}
\noindent\emph{%
It is impossible to disassociate language from science or science from
language, because every natural science always involves three things:
the sequence of phenomena on which the science is based, the abstract
concepts which call these phenomena to mind, and the words in which
the concepts are expressed. To call forth a concept, a word is needed;
to portray a phenomenon, a concept is needed. All three mirror one and
the same reality.}
